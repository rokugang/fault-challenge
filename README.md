# Automotive Fault Detection

Built for the Doutor-IE ML challenge. This detects rich air-fuel mixture at idle plus low battery voltage using OBD-II scanner data from Brazilian vehicles.

## Quick Start

### Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Check Everything Works
```bash
python scripts/run_verifications.py
```
Outputs coverage stats and detection results for all logs.

```bash
python -m pytest
```
Runs 5 unit tests (loader, features, detector).

## How It Works

### Data Loading
`src/data/loader.py` reads CSVs, strips units (`°C`, `%`, `V`), converts Brazilian decimal commas to dots, and validates context columns. Rejects logs with <99% coverage or non-zero trouble codes.

### Features
`src/features/engineering.py` builds:
- Rich-idle score (STFT ≤ -8%, lambda ≥ 0.8V, idle RPM)
- Low-battery score (voltage < 12V)
- Rolling averages and EMA for MAP, RPM, load

### Detection
Two approaches available:

**Rule-Based** (`src/detection/detector.py`):
- Rich idle ≥5% of frames (justified by EDA: P95+2σ from clean references)
- Low voltage ≤12V min OR ≥5% affected frames
- Both present = fault

**ML-Enhanced** (`src/ml/detector.py`):
- Trained on 24,100 samples from 9 clean reference files
- Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, LOF, Mahalanobis tested
- Combines ML anomaly scores with domain rules
- Outputs confidence level (high/medium/low)

### Usage
CLI:
```bash
python -m src.cli detect datasets/fault_example.csv
```

API:
```bash
python -m src.cli serve  # starts on :8000
curl -F "file=@datasets/fault_example.csv" http://localhost:8000/detect
```

## Results

Verification suite shows 8/16 reference files pass quality checks. The others have low coverage or trouble codes (see `docs/validation.md`).

`fault_example.csv` correctly triggers detection:
- 11 rich-idle frames (11%)
- 23 low-voltage frames (14%)
- No temporal overlap (validates aggregation logic)

## Issues Found

- 8 reference CSVs fail quality checks (documented in `docs/validation.md`)
- Some have <99% coverage on context columns
- Others have non-zero trouble codes flagged
- Training should use only the clean 8 files

## ML Experiments & EDA

Ran threshold justification analysis on 9 clean reference files:
- **Rich-idle threshold (5%)**: Conservative based on P95+2σ=160% in normal data
- **STFT threshold (-8%)**: Derived from P5=-4% in references
- **Lambda threshold (0.8V)**: Based on P90=0.76V in references
- **Voltage threshold (12V)**: Domain knowledge (typical car battery)

Trained and compared 4 ML algorithms (24,100 samples, 41 features):
- **Isolation Forest**: 1.7s training, best for unsupervised anomaly detection
- **One-Class SVM**: 3.8-23s training, RBF kernel
- **Local Outlier Factor**: 4.2-7s training, density-based
- **Mahalanobis Distance**: 0.2s training, statistical baseline

Results saved in `artifacts/ml_models/` and `artifacts/eda_threshold_analysis.json`.

## Future Improvements

- Add temporal windows to aggregate faults across drive cycles
- Tune contamination rates based on production false positive metrics
- Extend to multi-class fault taxonomy (beyond rich-mixture/low-voltage)

## Challenge Requirements

Meets functional requirements:
1. Outputs fault detection results
2. Uses reference dataset as baseline
3. ETL cleans and validates data
4. Detects deviations (rule-based)
5. Identifies induced fault case
6. CLI + API interfaces
