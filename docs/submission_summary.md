# Submission Summary

## What's Done

ETL (`src/data/loader.py`):
- Reads CSVs with Brazilian locale handling
- Strips units and validates context columns
- Rejects logs with coverage <99% or trouble codes >0

Features (`src/features/engineering.py`):
- Rich-idle score (STFT, lambda, RPM combo)
- Low-battery score (voltage thresholds)
- Rolling stats and EMA smoothing

Detection (`src/detection/detector.py`):
- Rule-based fault flagging (≥5% rich-idle + low voltage)
- Correctly detects `fault_example.csv`

Interfaces:
- CLI: `python -m src.cli detect <file>`
- API: FastAPI on `:8000` with `/detect` endpoint

Tests:
- 5 unit tests pass (loader, features, detector)
- Verification script checks all datasets

## Quick Validation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m pytest                    # 5 tests pass
python scripts/run_verifications.py # checks all data
python -m src.cli detect datasets/fault_example.csv
```

## Data Issues Found

8/16 reference files fail quality checks (see `docs/validation.md` for details):
- Some have <99% coverage on context columns
- Others have non-zero trouble codes
- Only use the 8 clean files for training

Fault example works correctly:
- 11% rich-idle frames
- 14% low-voltage frames  
- No overlap (separate time segments)

## Known Limitations

This uses rule-based thresholds, not trained ML. To make it actually "ML":
- Train isolation forest or autoencoder on clean reference features
- Use anomaly scores instead of hard thresholds
- Add temporal windowing for transient faults
- Tune on false positive rate from production

## What's Included

- `src/` - ETL, features, detection, CLI, API
- `tests/` - Unit tests (all passing)
- `scripts/` - Verification automation
- `docs/` - This summary, validation steps, README
- `artifacts/` - Generated profiling and feature CSVs

## Requirements Met

✓ Outputs fault detection results  
✓ Uses reference data as baseline  
✓ ETL with validation  
✓ Detects deviations (rule-based)  
✓ Finds induced fault case  
✓ CLI + API interfaces
